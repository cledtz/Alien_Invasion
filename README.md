# Alien Invasion

This repository contains a simple 2D game which is one of the three projects from the book [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse) by Eric Matthes.

To run the game simply run alien_invasion.py using python3 (requires pygame installed). You might need to tweak the speedup_scale parameter in the settings.py file.

To move ship right/left use right/left arrows. The space key fires bullets and the key M fires missiles.
